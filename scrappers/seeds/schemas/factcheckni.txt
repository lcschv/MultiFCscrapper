None   CLAIM: Pet owners travelling from Northern Ireland to Ireland require “EU pet passports”.   CONCLUSION: True. This includes your pet being marked by a transponder (microchip) and vaccinated against rabies. There are presently no border checks for pets (as official policy); however it is uncertain what regulations will apply post-Brexit.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/northern-ireland-pets-need-passports-ireland/   None   brexit   None   None   None   Do Northern Ireland pets need passports for Ireland?   5th October 2018   None
None   CLAIM: There are 208 border crossings between Ireland and Northern Ireland.   CONCLUSION: Unproven. It is extremely difficult to accurately establish the exact number of border crossings, as many informal routes have been established since border infrastructure was removed and many are on private land, but the official number of main routes so far identified by the Irish and Northern Ireland governments is 208.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/208-ireland-northern-ireland-border-crossings/   None   brexit   None   None   None   Are there 208 Ireland-Northern Ireland border crossings?   8th June 2018   None
None   CLAIM: 60% of sales from Northern Ireland go to Great Britain.   CONCLUSION: Accurate; however the true figure is closer to 56%.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/northern-ireland-sell-60-goods-great-britain/   None   brexit   None   None   None   Does Northern Ireland sell 60% of its goods to Great Britain?   12th March 2018   None
None   CLAIM: 30,000 people cross Ireland-Northern Ireland border daily.   CONCLUSION: Accurate. Indeed, this may be a low estimation, excluding train and other road journeys.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/do-30000-people-cross-ireland-northern-ireland-border-daily/   None   brexit   None   None   None   Do 30,000 people cross Ireland-Northern Ireland border daily?   27th April 2017   None
None   CLAIM: The voting results from Northern Ireland of the EU referendum compels the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to call a border boll.   CONCLUSION: False. The Secretary of State may bring forth a border poll when presented with evidence that a majority of electors may choose to change the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. There has been no evidence yet published.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/must-the-sos-call-a-post-brexit-border-poll/   None   brexit   None   None   None   Must the SoS call a post-Brexit border poll?   18th July 2016   None
None   CLAIM: Over a quarter of a million people migrate to the UK from the EU every year.   CONCLUSION: The claim is true, but it doesn't include the amount of people migrating from the UK to the EU: net migration in 2015 was +184,000. There is no single source that tracks migration to Northern Ireland. Medical card registrations are one method. The 2011 Census showed that 2.16% of the Northern Ireland population held an EU/EEA passport.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/what-is-eu-to-northern-ireland-net-migration/   None   brexit   None   None   None   What is EU to Northern Ireland net migration?   23rd June 2016   None
None   CLAIM: Northern Ireland is a net contributor to the EU.   CONCLUSION: This claim is false, as we estimate that Northern Ireland was a net recipient of £74 million in the 2014/15 financial year. Others have claimed that Northern Ireland is a recipient of £58 million, but this fails to take into account the requirement for match funding under the PEACE Programme and the exact value of farm subsidies.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/is-northern-ireland-a-net-contributor-to-the-eu/   None   brexit   None   None   None   Is Northern Ireland a net contributor to the EU?   15th June 2016   None
None   CLAIM: A customs frontier between Ireland and Northern Ireland land border is unavoidable in the event of a United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union.   CONCLUSION: There is no non-EU member state that currently has a customs-free border with the EU, even if they are members of the Schengen Area and maintain the free movement of people. There is no existing model that would permit the continued lack of a customs frontier in Northern Ireland if the UK left the EU.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/would-brexit-lead-to-a-customs-frontier/   None   brexit   None   None   None   Would Brexit lead to a customs frontier?   18th May 2016   None
None   CLAIM: Lord Mandelson speaking about the border with Ireland in case of Brexit:  “It would mean a return to customs posts, border checks; I don’t know exactly what the arrangements would be …”   CONCLUSION: Travel between the UK and Ireland is currently unaffected by EU membership, as they have both opted out of joining the Schengen Area and maintained their own Common Travel Area since long before the EU came into existence. If the UK left Europe, then the land border with Northern Ireland could be maintained by the introduction of internal border enforcement and/or greater cooperation between British and Irish governments in a shared policy toward their external borders.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/would-brexit-lead-to-northern-ireland-land-border-checks/   None   brexit   None   None   None   Would Brexit lead to Northern Ireland land border checks?   2nd May 2016   None
None   CLAIM: 1 in 8 jobs in Northern Ireland is supported by European Union (EU) membership.   CONCLUSION: While 1 in 8 jobs in Northern Ireland is not necessarily dependent on EU membership, a growing portion of the labour market is related to trade with the EU. This growth is particularly substantial in Northern Ireland, and it is difficult to predict if it would be sustained without the single market.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/1-in-8-jobs-is-supported-by-eu-membership/   None   brexit   None   None   None   Are 1 in 8 jobs supported by EU membership?   15th April 2016   None
None   CLAIM: There are 100,000 adults in Northern Ireland who have no home.   CONCLUSION: Misleading headline from estimated data. The figure is based on estimations of incomplete data and does not distinguish between statutory and “potential hidden homeless”. The majority of the estimated latter represent non-dependent (adult) children living in the parental household. More accurate data may come from collection by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive or independent research.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/100000-adults-northern-ireland-no-home/   None   economy   None   None   None   Are there 100,000 adults in Northern Ireland with no home?   16th July 2018   None
None   CLAIM: There are 12,500 millionaires living in Northern Ireland.   CONCLUSION: Unproven. The information published by Barclays Wealth & Investments contains proprietary data and cannot be checked. There is also a lack of official data on wealth in Northern Ireland.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/are-there-12500-millionaires-living-in-northern-ireland/   None   economy   None   None   None   Are there 12,500 millionaires living in Northern Ireland?   14th June 2018   None
None   CLAIM: 60% of sales from Northern Ireland go to Great Britain.   CONCLUSION: Accurate; however the true figure is closer to 56%.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/northern-ireland-sell-60-goods-great-britain/   None   economy   None   None   None   Does Northern Ireland sell 60% of its goods to Great Britain?   12th March 2018   None
None   CLAIM: All taxis can use bus lanes in many cities in Ireland and the UK.   CONCLUSION: Partly accurate. True in Ireland, but most UK cities only allow public taxis access, not private-hire cars.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/are-all-taxis-allowed-in-bus-lanes/   None   economy   None   None   None   Are all taxis allowed in bus lanes?   11th January 2018   None
None   CLAIM: There was a rock fall on the Antrim coast road on 9 August 2017.   CONCLUSION: False. The image is a cropped version of one published in a local American newspaper, reporting on a rock fall that took place in Lawrence County, Ohio, on 10 April 2015.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/did-a-large-rock-fall-onto-the-antrim-coast-road/   None   economy   None   None   None   Did a large rock fall onto the Antrim coast road?   13th August 2017   None
None   CLAIM: 77% of working mothers endure some kind of discrimination.   CONCLUSION: The claim is misleading. It is correct for mothers in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) but the statistic stated on BBC Radio Ulster does not apply to women in Northern Ireland. However, women here do report having felt discriminated in the workplace due to being pregnant or a mother: 36% of mothers report feeling they were treated unfairly, and 50% of mothers believing their career opportunities are worse than before pregnancy.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/do-77-of-mothers-face-discrimination-at-work/   None   economy   None   None   None   Do 77% of mothers face discrimination at work?   2nd December 2016   None
None   CLAIM: Low childcare provision contributes to low levels of female employment in Northern Ireland.   CONCLUSION: The claim may be misleading. While childcare provision is more limited in Northern Ireland than in Great Britain, and female employment rates are lower in Northern Ireland than the UK average, there is insufficient evidence of a causal link between childcare provision and female (versus maternal) employment in this case. According to the most recently available data, Northern Ireland actually has higher maternal employment rates than the UK average.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/has-low-childcare-provision-caused-a-low-female-employment-rate/   None   economy   None   None   None   Has low childcare provision caused a low female employment rate?   8th August 2016   None
None   CLAIM: Northern Ireland were once net contributors of revenue to HM Treasury.   CONCLUSION: True, up until the 1930s. But data show that Northern Ireland has run a fiscal deficit since 1966.  The most recent figure, from 2013-14, is a subvention of £9.2 billion.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/how-dependent-is-stormont-on-westminster-subvention/   None   economy   None   None   None   How dependent is Stormont on Westminster subvention?   24th May 2016   None
None   CLAIM: A customs frontier between Ireland and Northern Ireland land border is unavoidable in the event of a United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union.   CONCLUSION: There is no non-EU member state that currently has a customs-free border with the EU, even if they are members of the Schengen Area and maintain the free movement of people. There is no existing model that would permit the continued lack of a customs frontier in Northern Ireland if the UK left the EU.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/would-brexit-lead-to-a-customs-frontier/   None   economy   None   None   None   Would Brexit lead to a customs frontier?   18th May 2016   None
None   CLAIM: The number of Catholics and Protestants in the workforce in Northern Ireland is at 50-50.   CONCLUSION: Recent data show a marked increase of Catholics in the workforce, to nearly as many of Protestants. However, the margin of error in the research survey could mean that the actual percentage is higher, or lower, by 2%.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/is-the-northern-ireland-workforce-50-50-protestant-catholic/   None   economy   None   None   None   Is the Northern Ireland workforce 50-50 Protestant-Catholic?   11th May 2016   None
None   CLAIM: The 'NI Our Time, Our Place' campaign in 2012 helped to attract 1,000,000 visitors to Northern Ireland and brought £40 million to the local economy.   CONCLUSION: This claim relies on a report by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, without research methodology or sources provided. Other evidence demonstrates a growing trend in visitor numbers. The 'NI Our Time, Our Place' campaign may have made a positive contribution. However, Northern Ireland still lags behind other economies in the region.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/did-the-ni-2012-our-time-our-place-campaign-help-bring-in-one-million-visitors/   None   economy   None   None   None   Did the ‘NI 2012 – Our Time, Our Place’ campaign help bring in one million visitors?   3rd May 2016   None
None   CLAIM: In 2015, nearly 1% of employees were not paid minimum wage.   CONCLUSION: This claim can be substantiated by numerous government surveys and reports. There has been further investigation by organisations in the United Kingdom to determine who is most affected, the causes behind non-compliance, and solutions for the problem.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/do-almost-1-of-people-earn-less-than-the-minimum-wage/   None   economy   None   None   None   Do almost 1% of people earn less than the minimum wage?   3rd May 2016   None
None   CLAIM: 21% of people in Northern Ireland are living with a long-term health problem or disability.   CONCLUSION: Dr Michael Wardlow accurately presented the percentage of Northern Ireland residents who are affected by an illness or disability which affects their daily tasks. These rates are in line with the rest of the United Kingdom (UK), and while prevalence in Northern Ireland is slightly above the overall average, when all regional fluctuations are taken into account it is not an outlier.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/are-1-in-5-people-living-with-a-disability/   None   economy   None   None   None   Are 1 in 5 people living with a disability?   25th April 2016   None
None   CLAIM: Northern Ireland has the lowest disposable income in the UK.   CONCLUSION: While Northern Ireland is experiencing growth in discretionary income, it is still disproportionately behind the rest of the UK.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/northern-ireland-lowest-disposable-income-in-the-uk/   None   economy   None   None   None   Northern Ireland: Lowest disposable income in the UK?   11th April 2016   None
None   CLAIM: A third of Church of Ireland ministry candidates are women.   CONCLUSION: Inaccurate. A quarter of CoI accepted and enrolled candidates are women. For the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, its figures of less than 4% female candidates are considerably lower than the phrase “don’t have nearly as many women as men” would suggest. For the Methodist Church in Ireland, a third of its candidates are women.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/third-coi-ministry-candidates-women/   None   education   None   None   None   Are a third of CoI ministry candidates women?   30th August 2018   None
None   CLAIM: “For every child coming into school in Northern Ireland, they are getting much less than their counterparts in other regions of the United Kingdom.”   CONCLUSION: Correct with consideration. Public expenditure on pre-primary and primary education in Northern Ireland is least per child (£3,440; UK average: £4,316) and per head of population (£416; UK average: £473). Meanwhile, Northern Ireland has the second highest level of expenditure on overall education per head of population (£1,453); the situation is better explained by the amount spent per head on education subsidies and n.e.c. categories (£257; UK average: £102).   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/primary-pupils-receive-least-per-child/   None   education   None   None   None   Do our primary pupils receive least per child?   28th March 2018   None
None   CLAIM: “…a third of young people from Northern Ireland who go to university travel outside Northern Ireland, mainly to the North West of England and Scotland, and only a third of those who graduate return back home.”   CONCLUSION: Accurate. However, the claim that “a third of young people from Northern Ireland who go to university travel outside Northern Ireland” is closer to a quarter.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/third-graduates-return-northern-ireland/   None   education   None   None   None   Do a third of graduates return to Northern Ireland?   23rd March 2018   None
None   CLAIM: The Irish News wrote that a funding cut places hundreds of youth work posts at risk.   CONCLUSION: There is no evidence of any cut, nor any proposed cut. Yet there is uncertainty about continued funding, for this and other programmes, in light of the composition of a new Northern Ireland Executive (or direct rule governance) after elections in March 2017.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/funding-cut-youth-work/   None   education   None   None   None   Was funding cut for youth work?   23rd February 2017   None
None   CLAIM: “The DUP at no point has ever agreed to establish an Irish Language Act with the UK government, with the Irish government, with Sinn Féin or anybody else.”   CONCLUSION: The claim is accurate: The St Andrew's Agreement committed the UK Government to an Irish Language Act, but subsequent legislation compelled the Northern Ireland Executive to produce a strategy (which may or may not include an Irish Language Act).   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/thejournal-ie-dup-really-never-commit-irish-language-act/   None   education   None   None   None   TheJournal.ie: Did the DUP really never commit to an Irish Language Act?   30th January 2017   None
None   CLAIM: The United Kingdom has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Europe.   CONCLUSION: True. However, the teenage pregnancy rate in Northern Ireland was the lowest within the British Isles in 2014.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/teenage-pregnancy-rise-northern-ireland/   None   education   None   None   None   Does Northern Ireland have a high teenage pregnancy rate?   24th August 2016   None
None   CLAIM: 38% of students have to leave Northern Ireland at age 18 for higher education.   CONCLUSION: Most recent data show a third (33.5%) of school leavers continue studies outside Northern Ireland. While public investment policy in further education is a significant factor, others must be considered, such as the desire and ability to take up opportunities elsewhere. Thus it is misleading to say that 38% have to leave; some leave because they wish to.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/do-38-of-students-have-to-leave-northern-ireland/   None   education   None   None   None   Do 38% of students have to leave Northern Ireland?   21st June 2016   None
None   CLAIM: Since 2011 the Sinn Féin Education Minister John O’Dowd has "improved educational outcomes for the most disadvantaged", and consequently "58.5% of children receiving Free School Meals (FSM) now obtain 5 GCSEs A*-C, compared to 31.5% previously."   CONCLUSION: The claim fails to distinguish between students that are eligible for FSM, as opposed to those who actually receive them. However, once corrected for this inaccuracy, it can be substantiated and verified by data from the Department of Education. In fact, there have been even greater improvements in performance among Free School Meal Eligible (FSME) students.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/has-sinn-fein-education-minister-improved-outcomes-for-most-disadvantaged/   None   education   None   None   None   Has Sinn Fein Education Minister improved outcomes for most disadvantaged?   4th May 2016   None
None   CLAIM: Progressive Politics NI claimed that MLAs were paid "nearly £2.2 million" in salaries up to 3rd September 2017.   CONCLUSION: Broadly accurate. The annual salary of an MLA is £49,500. For the period covered by the claim (13/3-13/9/2017), MLAs received a combined estimate of £2,333,188.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/how-much-do-mlas-earn-or-not/   None   elections   None   None   None   How much do MLAs earn (or not)?   21st October 2017   None

None   CLAIM: In Northern Ireland, more people speak Polish than speak Irish.   CONCLUSION: Mostly false. While the 2011 Census data show more people in Northern Ireland speaking Polish than Irish as their main language, based on other available data it is implausible that there are more who speak Polish than Irish.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/thejournal-ie-really-polish-speakers-irish-speakers-northern-ireland/   None   elections   None   None   None   TheJournal.ie: Are there really more Polish speakers than Irish speakers in Northern Ireland?   13th February 2017   None

None   CLAIM: Under an Alliance Minister of Justice, crime rates in Northern Ireland are lower.   CONCLUSION: According to PSNI reports, annual offences covering the relevant period are marginally higher (105,289 versus 105,040). Meanwhile, crime in Northern Ireland has been rising every year since 2012/13.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/crime-rise-northern-ireland/   None   elections   None   None   None   Is crime on the rise in Northern Ireland?   4th May 2016   None

None   CLAIM: The 'NI Our Time, Our Place' campaign in 2012 helped to attract 1,000,000 visitors to Northern Ireland and brought £40 million to the local economy.   CONCLUSION: This claim relies on a report by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, without research methodology or sources provided. Other evidence demonstrates a growing trend in visitor numbers. The 'NI Our Time, Our Place' campaign may have made a positive contribution.

None   CLAIM: Pet owners travelling from Northern Ireland to Ireland require “EU pet passports”.   CONCLUSION: True. This includes your pet being marked by a transponder (microchip) and vaccinated against rabies. There are presently no border checks for pets (as official policy); however it is uncertain what regulations will apply post-Brexit.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/northern-ireland-pets-need-passports-ireland/   None   europe   None   None   None   Do Northern Ireland pets need passports for Ireland?   5th October 2018   None
None   CLAIM: There are 208 border crossings between Ireland and Northern Ireland.   CONCLUSION: Unproven. It is extremely difficult to accurately establish the exact number of border crossings, as many informal routes have been established since border infrastructure was removed and many are on private land, but the official number of main routes so far identified by the Irish and Northern Ireland governments is 208.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/208-ireland-northern-ireland-border-crossings/   None   europe   None   None   None   Are there 208 Ireland-Northern Ireland border crossings?   8th June 2018   None

None   CLAIM: Over a quarter of a million people migrate to the UK from the EU every year.   CONCLUSION: The claim is true, but it doesn't include the amount of people migrating from the UK to the EU: net migration in 2015 was +184,000. There is no single source that tracks migration to Northern Ireland. Medical card registrations are one method.

None   CLAIM: Northern Ireland is a net contributor to the EU.   CONCLUSION: This claim is false, as we estimate that Northern Ireland was a net recipient of £74 million in the 2014/15 financial year. Others have claimed that Northern Ireland is a recipient of £58 million, but this fails to take into account the requirement for match funding under the PEACE Programme and the exact value of farm subsidies.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/is-northern-ireland-a-net-contributor-to-the-eu/   None   europe   None   None   None   Is Northern Ireland a net contributor to the EU?   15th June 2016   None
None   CLAIM: "The health service in Northern Ireland will especially benefit from the requirement for foreigners - including those from the Republic of Ireland - to pay for hospital treatment." - Sammy Wilson, Belfast Telegraph, 19 May 2016   CONCLUSION: The claim, while technically accurate, is misleading. Under a variety of different circumstances, foreigners do pay for access to health care already.

None   CLAIM: A customs frontier between Ireland and Northern Ireland land border is unavoidable in the event of a United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union.   CONCLUSION: There is no non-EU member state that currently has a customs-free border with the EU, even if they are members of the Schengen Area and maintain the free movement of people. There is no existing model that would permit the continued lack of a customs frontier in Northern Ireland if the UK left the EU.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/would-brexit-lead-to-a-customs-frontier/   None   europe   None   None   None   Would Brexit lead to a customs frontier?   18th May 2016   None
None   CLAIM: Lord Mandelson speaking about the border with Ireland in case of Brexit:  “It would mean a return to customs posts, border checks; I don’t know exactly what the arrangements would be …”   CONCLUSION: Travel between the UK and Ireland is currently unaffected by EU membership, as they have both opted out of joining the Schengen Area and maintained their own Common Travel Area since long before the EU came into existence. If the UK left Europe, then the land border with Northern Ireland could be maintained by the introduction of internal border enforcement and/or greater cooperation between British and Irish governments in a shared policy toward their external borders.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/would-brexit-lead-to-northern-ireland-land-border-checks/   None   europe   None   None   None   Would Brexit lead to Northern Ireland land border checks?   2nd May 2016   None
None   CLAIM: 1 in 8 jobs in Northern Ireland is supported by European Union (EU) membership.   CONCLUSION: While 1 in 8 jobs in Northern Ireland is not necessarily dependent on EU membership, a growing portion of the labour market is related to trade with the EU. This growth is particularly substantial in Northern Ireland, and it is difficult to predict if it would be sustained without the single market.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/1-in-8-jobs-is-supported-by-eu-membership/   None   europe   None   None   None   Are 1 in 8 jobs supported by EU membership?   15th April 2016   None
None   CLAIM: A third of Church of Ireland ministry candidates are women.   CONCLUSION: Inaccurate. A quarter of CoI accepted and enrolled candidates are women. For the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, its figures of less than 4% female candidates are considerably lower than the phrase “don’t have nearly as many women as men” would suggest. For the Methodist Church in Ireland, a third of its candidates are women.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/third-coi-ministry-candidates-women/   None   facts   None   None   None   Are a third of CoI ministry candidates women?   30th August 2018   None

None   CLAIM: There are 208 border crossings between Ireland and Northern Ireland.   CONCLUSION: Unproven. It is extremely difficult to accurately establish the exact number of border crossings, as many informal routes have been established since border infrastructure was removed and many are on private land, but the official number of main routes so far identified by the Irish and Northern Ireland governments is 208.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/208-ireland-northern-ireland-border-crossings/   None   facts   None   None   None   Are there 208 Ireland-Northern Ireland border crossings?   8th June 2018   None

None   CLAIM: “For every child coming into school in Northern Ireland, they are getting much less than their counterparts in other regions of the United Kingdom.”   CONCLUSION: Correct with consideration. Public expenditure on pre-primary and primary education in Northern Ireland is least per child (£3,440; UK average: £4,316) and per head of population (£416; UK average: £473). Meanwhile, Northern Ireland has the second highest level of expenditure on overall education per head of population (£1,453); the situation is better explained by the amount spent per head on education subsidies and n.e.c. categories (£257; UK average: £102).   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/primary-pupils-receive-least-per-child/   None   facts   None   None   None   Do our primary pupils receive least per child?   28th March 2018   None

None   CLAIM: Northern Ireland is the happiest region in the UK.   CONCLUSION: The majority of people surveyed by ONS indicated being majority happy with their lives. However, statistically, Northern Ireland has some of the highest rates of mental health illness in the UK and some research has found quality of life to be low here.

It is correct for mothers in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) but the statistic stated on BBC Radio Ulster does not apply to women in Northern Ireland. However, women here do report having felt discriminated in the workplace due to being pregnant or a mother: 36% of mothers report feeling they were treated unfairly, and 50% of mothers believing their career opportunities are worse than before pregnancy.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/do-77-of-mothers-face-discrimination-at-work/   None   health   None   None   None   Do 77% of mothers face discrimination at work?   2nd December 2016   None

None   CLAIM: "The health service in Northern Ireland will especially benefit from the requirement for foreigners - including those from the Republic of Ireland - to pay for hospital treatment." - Sammy Wilson, Belfast Telegraph, 19 May 2016   CONCLUSION: The claim, while technically accurate, is misleading. Under a variety of different circumstances, foreigners do pay for access to health care already. The proposed legislation would seek ways to extend the scope for foreigners to contribute financially for NHS services, and to increase the incentives for debt recovery. The NHS would save significantly by simply collecting on what it is owed under current exchange schemes with foreign governments.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/irish-citizens-financial-strain-nhs-northern-ireland/   None   health   None   None   None   Are foreigners a financial strain on the NHS in Northern Ireland?   1st June 2016   None

CONCLUSION: The claim is true, but it doesn't include the amount of people migrating from the UK to the EU: net migration in 2015 was +184,000. There is no single source that tracks migration to Northern Ireland. Medical card registrations are one method.

However, while the article does break down re-offending rates among criminals released from prison, the majority of offenders receive sentences that do not require time in prison. The re-offending rate for Northern Ireland in 2012/13 was 18.5% for all offenders, which is similar to the rate documented in previous years, as well as in England & Wales.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/do-half-of-freed-criminals-reoffend-within-a-year/   None   law   None   None   None   Do half of freed criminals reoffend within a year?   28th July 2016   None

CONCLUSION: While data on sex workers in Ireland is extremely lacking, the figures that are available and most commonly employed by experts do not support this claim. There is no official data documenting the movement of sex workers south across the border, but whatever the scale, an 80% impact in Ireland is unlikely.   https://www.factcheckni.org/facts/has-northern-irelands-legislation-caused-an-80-rise-in-prostitution-in-ireland/   None   law   None   None   None   Has Northern Ireland’s legislation caused an 80% rise in sex workers in Ireland?   6th April 2016   None
