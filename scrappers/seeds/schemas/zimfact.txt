None   CLAIM: Zimbabwe’s government plans to introduce a diaspora tax and generate revenue from non-resident citizens.   VERDICT: False. A government spokesperson has said there is no such tax proposal. A fiscal policy statement issued by the Finance Minister on Friday, October 5 2018, the same day the article was published, makes no reference to a diaspora tax.   https://zimfact.org/zimbabwe-diaspora-tax/   www.thezimbabwenewslive site’s article has been proved to be false by both a government spokesperson and the Finance Minister’s official policy document for the next two and a quarter years.   in Economy, Fact Reports   Source: Online news site www.thezimbabwenewslive.com   by Nelson Banya   None   Is Zimbabwe introducing a diaspora tax?   2018-10-06T09:54:58+00:00   None
None   CLAIM: Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor John Mangudya has reneged on his 2016 promise that he would resign if bond notes did not succeed.   VERDICT: The central bank governor has gone back on his word.   https://zimfact.org/has-mangudya-reneged-on-his-bond-note-promise/   The RBZ’s decision this week to ring-fence foreign currency deposits from electronic balances and bond notes, effectively setting hard currencies from a ‘local currency’, is the clearest official admission that the unpopular parallel currency has failed. As bank note shortages started to bite in 2016, the central bank introduced the bond notes disguised as an export incentive. Although exports, which had started declining in 2013, started to recover after the introduction of export incentives ranging from 5 percent to 10 percent, bond notes have failed to restore the banking public’s transactional convenience. Despite Mangudya’s efforts to deceptively mask this fact, he falls on his word.   in Economy, Fact Reports   None   by Nelson Banya   None   Has Mangudya reneged on his bond note promise?   2018-10-05T10:10:54+00:00   None

None   CLAIM: Sky News’ Africa correspondent, John Sparks took to Twitter on Monday to announce that President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s spokesperson, George Charamba, had told the news channel that the president had lost to opposition challenger Nelson Chamisa.

None   On Friday, May 18, 2018, President Emmerson Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe had received a loan from the United Kingdom, which would go towards easing the country’s cash shortages.   None   https://zimfact.org/claim-that-uk-has-given-zim-100m-for-cash-shortages-incorrect/   While the loan will improve Zimbabwean businesses’ access to foreign currency, improve local production and reduce pressure on the country’s current account in the long term, it is incorrect to say, as Mnangagwa claimed, that the British have given Zimbabwe funds to ease its cash crisis.   in Economy, Fact Reports   None   by Nelson Banya   None   Claim that UK has given Zim $100m ‘for cash shortages’ incorrect   2018-05-21T13:09:02+00:00   None

None   The Sunday Mail this week reported that Zimbabwe’s bank note shortage would ease, following US$400 million cash imports by the central bank since the beginning of the year, as well as improvements in the production and sale of key commodities – gold and tobacco.
