Determination: Mostly True	https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/fact/where-do-people-buy-crack/	Analysis: Obviously McElroy doesn’t know if every Poway resident seeking to buy crack goes to 17th and K, so we want to analyze the statement’s implication: The downtown area is a regional hotspot for the drug trade.

Determination: Huckster Propaganda	https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/fact/who-can-bid-work-for-pla-projects/	Analysis: Christen’s editorial blasted project labor agreements, or PLAs, which are pre-hire agreements used by government for some public works contracts.
