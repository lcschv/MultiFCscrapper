8	Reality check: Andrea Leadsom's economic vision	Leadsom’s analysis lacks credibility and her plan for the future lacks policies. As a vision, it ranks alongside that of Ukip, with her emphasis on building relations with the Commonwealth, and consumers rejecting foreign-made goods in favour of buying British. A lower currency can bring some benefits, but not if it is a judgment on the strength of the economy. If the UK suffers a recession, that is a more important factor than a fall in the pound. Foreign investors will flee. Some anti-EU economists say good riddance, but just like Leadsom’s “buy British” campaign to help the balance of payments and boost the economy, a shift to higher domestic investment is going to take a long time and will need to reverse more than 30 years of reliance on foreigners. 	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/jul/07/reality-check-andrea-leadsom-economic-vision	None	['Andrea Leadsom']	None	Phillip Inman	None	Reality check: Andrea Leadsom's economic vision	7 July 2016	None

18	Is there a cover-up over UK migration figures?	These factors tend to make the Nino figures highly unreliable as measures of migration flows. However, Portes has a point when he says there needs to be more light shone on the discrepancy. In particular, publishing data on the number of “active” national insurance numbers would increase trust in their accuracy. But until that happens they can’t simply be substituted for the official migration figures by newspapers that don’t like the fact they are going in what they consider to be the wrong direction. 	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/reality-check/2016/feb/26/cover-up-uk-migration-figures-reality-check	None	['Immigration and asylum']	None	Alan Travis	None	Is there a cover-up over UK migration figures?	26 February 2016	None

The economy will still have a structural deficit in 2015-16, and the national debt will continue to increase every year until then. In his 2010 budget the chancellor forecast neither of those things, and the size of the gap is significant. The effect of accounting changes has also made easier the fiscal juggling for Osborne, giving an extra £71bn with which to pay off the debt in the short to medium term (though in the long term, the government is committed to pay that back). 	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2012/dec/05/reality-check-george-osborne-debt-deficit	None	['George Osborne']	None	James Ball	None	Reality check: is George Osborne on track to cut the debt and deficit?	5 December 2012	None

140	Politics blog  How Nick Clegg got it wrong on debt	Starting from first principles, several factors make the economy grow. These include a rising population, an increase in the number of people working and technological progress. Growth varies from year to year annually but it is assumed to have an average rate consistent with hitting the government's inflation target. Before the recession, this trend rate of growth was assumed to be 2.5% or so. During the global downturn, the economy performed much worse than this. In 2009, for example, the economy contracted by 5%, some 7.5 percentage points below its trend. The level of activity is still some 4% below where it was at its previous peak in spring 2008. Recessions play havoc with the public finances because fewer people are working, consumers spend less, businesses make smaller profits and the cost of welfare benefits goes up. In the UK, the budget deficit – the gap between what the government spends and what it gathers in taxes – ballooned to more than £160bn in the 2009-10 financial year, which is more than 11% of annual national output. 	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/may/09/nickclegg-davidcameron	None	['Politics blog', 'Nick Clegg']	None	Polly Curtis	None	Politics blog  How Nick Clegg got it wrong on debt	9 May 2012	None

142	Boris Johnson v Ken Livingstone: who is right about council tax savings?	Both candidates are promising to freeze council tax if they win this election. Johnson's website gives a confusing impression claiming that a council tax freeze would save Londoners £445 over a term. While he is promising to freeze the part of council tax that the mayor controls, those are savings he claims Londoners have already enjoyed during his current term in office. Those savings are also made on assumptions based on Livingstone's previous record in office. There is no proof that Livingstone would have increased council tax by as much as the Johnson campaign claims and indeed a central government council tax freeze suggests that it's highly unlikely that he would have for one of the years. Johnson is right that in the past year he has cut council tax but the savings to Londoners won't go very far. It amounted to £3.10 for the average band D home over a year. 	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/apr/13/ken-boris-council-tax-savings	None	['London mayoral election 2012']	None	Polly Curtis	None	Boris Johnson v Ken Livingstone: who is right about council tax savings?	13 April 2012	None

145	Reality check: Scottish independence  Who would get the oil revenues if Scotland became independent?	It is hard to argue against oil revenues following the physical locations of the fields. That is the way international agreements have generally been made - for instance the recent treaty between Norway and Russia covering the Barents Sea. But some account must surely be made of the historical contributions of London-based groups such as BP for their role in extracting the oil at huge initial expense. Clearly it is fair also to argue that Scotland has benefited from higher levels of public spending from Whitehall plus the financial bail out of Royal Bank of Scotland. The oil question will need to be thrown into a wider mix around issues such as defence. There will be a war of words over the North Sea but presumably not a clash of weapons as was seen over oil in the north and south of Sudan. Do you have more evidence that might change our verdict? Get in touch below the line and we'll update our findings. 11.45am: There are many interesting points raised here, some suggesting that the North Sea has more financial investment than ever – so no sign of that much-vaunted "end of Britain's oil" story. Unfortunately, the rate of production is falling at record levels. The latest figures for 2011 say oil and gas output is down by 18% and, although there are a few high profile new schemes, the UK – or Scotland and England – are running to keep up. These are old fields depleting very fast and the new projects tend to be smaller (but more expensive). Well maybe for some. But who will pay for the old field platforms to be dismantled if the oil companies argue that their legal inheritance to keep producing on old terms agreed with the UK government has been changed? 12.00pm: My colleague Severin Carrell caught up with the energy minister, Charles Hendry, the other day and sent me over these comments about why oil is best of British: 12.28pm: There have been many requests for some hard figures figures on North Sea tax revenues. It is a movable feast and economists, as well as politicians, can change their minds. The non-partisan Office of Budget Responsibility argues that the UK will bring in £11.1bn in the 2011/12 financial year, which will close at the end of this month. But there again, earlier in the year the OBR was telling the government to expect £13.4bn. The change is to do with the faster than expected fall in oil and gas production. This cash all goes to the Treasury in London and then is distributed back to Scotland and the regions. 3.07pm: Professor Alexander Kemp, of Aberdeen University, has long been an excellent source of detailed information on the North Sea. 5.24pm: OK. I think we are going to have to wrap it up there. It's Friday afternoon and the family weekend beckons. Very many thanks for all those who have contributed to a civilised and constructive debate on a potentially-emotive issue. The past cast a shadow over the hundreds of different comments as much as the future and this may influence discussions should political independence become a reality. North Sea platforms have been pumping for over 30 years and there have been many reminders that a lot of public cash has been raised in taxes (and occasionally mis-spent) - certainly not set aside in any way for future generations as in Norway. The current tax take for this year is put at over £11bn but the future is uncertain. There will be further declines in oil and gas output but global prices can be expected to keep on rising - even above the very high level of $128 per barrel reached earlier this week. There has been more debate on how any the past legacy of investment would be dealt with and plenty of discussion about whether operators and their facilities and workers could partly decamp to England, if corporation tax and others fiscal measures made it better. There seems little argument that Scotland would secure its 90% stake in the oil, on the basis of the fields being located below the seabed of its teritorial waters. But there is always opportunities for disagreement over oil. Russia and Norway agreed last summer how they would divide up the oil-rich Barents Sea but a deal only came after decades of negotiation. The debate over Scottish oil has only just begun. 	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/mar/02/oil-revenues-if-scotland-became-independent	None	['Reality check: Scottish independence', 'UK news']	None	Terry Macalister	None	Reality check: Scottish independence  Who would get the oil revenues if Scotland became independent?	2 March 2012	None

148	How many unemployed people are there in the UK?	This is without including whichever people working multiple jobs are job-hunting, or the under-employed. Such figures help to explain the huge application ratios many jobseekers report experiencing in a way just comparing the headline 2.67 million unemployed figure to 476,000 vacancies might not. As to which is the best measure of unemployment – that's trickier, and likely a measure of individual judgment: who should we count? A final note, for now, is to look at the effect on the gender balance of the unemployed. If we look at headline unemployment, men have it substantially worse and have done so for a long time (though research suggests more women than men are losing their jobs in the current climate). Using the wider measures, however, tips the scales slightly in the other direction. Of the 6.9 million people in the broad jobseekers' measure, women slightly outnumber men, at 3.46 million compared with 3.41 million. Women looking for work, it seems, are more likely to crop up in the less obvious corners of the statistics. 3.36pm update: Thanks for a really interesting discussion in the comments, and to everyone who emailed with outside data or personal stories. As ever on this topic, they've been particularly helpful. Several people wondered whether their own situation would be incorporated in the jobless statistics – particularly those looking for work without being "signed on" or using the Job Centres. Sarah Clarkson of the GMB got in touch by email with a different way of measuring unempployment, used by the European Commission's statistics agency Eurostat. This measures people with "low work intensity" – defined as adults who spend less than 20% of the time they could be working at work – and its effect on poverty. The UK seems to do badly by such a measure, Clarkson notes: Kelley noted under-employment prevented a risk for such families as taking multiple jobs was more difficult with childcare and other commitments: That rounds off today's Reality Check, but as ever it's a topic we feel there's more to dig around in, and more to be checked. Feel free to suggest topics you think we should look at, either by email or Twitter (details above), or in the comments thread below. 	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/feb/16/unemployed-uk-how-many	None	['Unemployment']	None	James Ball	None	How many unemployed people are there in the UK?	16 February 2012	None

151	News blog  Would an independent Scotland be forced to join the euro?	There is no precedent to Scotland's position vis-a-vis the EU. By law if it is considered a new state it would have negotiate entry to the EU from scratch, although it would readily satisfy its tests having been a member already. Any new member state has to join the euro. Whether it is considered a new state or whether it would retain any of the UK's exemptions, would have to be negotiated with the 27 member states of the EU – including the remainder of the UK. One follower of this blog, @taylorig, made an interesting interpretation of this question on Twitter: "If Scotland is independent, why should the UK let them use the £? Go make your own currency if you don't like the club!" It chimed with what one government official I spoke with for this blog told me when he referred in passing to Scotland's membership of the "sterling zone". Update 2.40pm Thursday January 12: There has been a lot of comment online about my interpretation of Stephen Noon's blog and I'm still trying to get absolute clarity on this. In the meantime, Alyn Smith MEP has responded to this blog saying: 11.17am, Friday January 13: I misinterpreted Stephen Noon's blog and it seems there is a stage at which Scotland can decide whether to join the euro. It's still expected by the EU, but it's not automatic. This is the exchange of emails between myself and Stephen Noon from yesterday. I think my conclusion still stands, that ultimately the EU will expect Scotland to join the euro and that it comes down to a political negotiation between an independent Scotland and the EU as to when and how that happens. However, the SNP is right in saying that they could hold a referendum on it and in the case of Sweden the EU has currently allowed this to be delayed for its own internal political reasons. Whether Scotland can follow the case of Sweden though will be subject to a political negotiation. 	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/jan/11/would-an-independent-scotland-join-the-euro	None	['News blog', 'UK news']	None	Polly Curtis	None	News blog  Would an independent Scotland be forced to join the euro?	11 January 2012	None
152	2011 in review  Has 2011 really been the busiest year for news in recent memory?	Web traffic and TV news viewing figures suggest that the undeniably extraordinary events of 2011 made for a particularly busy news year but the changing habits in the way people keep up with the news - with the fall in newspaper sales and rise of social media such as Twitter - means it's impossible to measure, year on year, the true scale of news. I'll leave you with a selection of front pages as a little reminder of the last 12 months. 	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/dec/28/has-2011-been-a-busy-news-year	None	['2011 in review', 'UK news']	None	Polly Curtis	None	2011 in review  Has 2011 really been the busiest year for news in recent memory?	28 December 2011	None

154	Politics blog  Will David Cameron's veto protect the City?	Cameron's veto is not a veto in the traditional sense because the treaty has gone ahead regardless. Cameron's bid to safeguard the City could even have been harmed if relations now sour and Britain struggles to get support to oppose financial regulations come to a vote of the full council. However, there is now room for further negotiations to avoid what could be a protracted legal battle over whether the 26 can use the institutions and courts of the EU. The government could still try and get some amendments to plans for a financial transactions tax, for example. This might also help ease some of Cameron's domestic troubles with the Liberal Democrats - all three major parties oppose a FTT confined to Europe alone. 	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/dec/12/debt-crisis-conservatives	None	['Politics blog', 'UK news']	None	Polly Curtis	None	Politics blog  Will David Cameron's veto protect the City?	12 December 2011	None
155	Politics blog  Is David Cameron right to dispute the child poverty figures?	The prime minister is wrong to blame child poverty solely on a statistical system that rates it in relative terms. Some policies will change the average household income, meaning the number of children in relative poverty increases. But this impact is almost certainly outweighed by policies which have reduced the income of the lowest earners and tipped more children into absolute poverty. Child poverty is rising in absolute terms as a result of the government's cuts. 	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/dec/01/child-benefit-poverty	None	['Politics blog', 'UK news']	None	Polly Curtis	None	Politics blog  Is David Cameron right to dispute the child poverty figures?	1 December 2011	None

157	Reality check: eurozone crisis  Is the UK's slow growth and high unemployment really caused by the eurozone crisis?	The government's claim that the eurozone is behind its economic struggles is weak. Sluggish growth pre-dates the current eurozone crisis. However, there are clear signs in the export market, employers' own predictions and consumer confidence that the crisis is now beginning to bite here in the UK. Labour is also being slightly disingenuous in its representation of the government's position - the ministers appear to be talking about more immediate economic problems of recent "weeks and months" rather than the last year or so. More clarification is needed from ministers so that they don't mislead people and blame the eurozone for a longer term economic problems. 	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/nov/14/debt-crisis-conservatives	None	['Reality check: eurozone crisis', 'UK news']	None	Polly Curtis	None	Reality check: eurozone crisis  Is the UK's slow growth and high unemployment really caused by the eurozone crisis?	14 November 2011	None

159	Politics blog  Reality check: how much is the Dale Farm eviction costing?	The council has a budget of £8m for the evictions, the police operation is thought to be around £10m with some suggestions that it could stretch to over £12.5m. The total bill is put at £18m by the council and £20.13m by the Dale Farm Solidarity campaign group. But these figures are extremely provisional and don't include the costs of the delays to the evictions after the court action last month. 11.30am: The Dale Farm Solidarity campaign's claim that residents at the site pay £40,000 worth of council tax is disputed by the council. A spokesman has just called to say that there are 50 properties registered to pay council tax at the site. Two accounts are paid, 25 receive council tax benefits and 23 are currently outstanding. "We are pursuing them as we would anyone who hasn't paid their council tax," the spokesman said. 	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/oct/19/reality-check-how-much-is-dale-farm-eviction-costing	None	['Politics blog', 'UK news']	None	Polly Curtis	None	Politics blog  Reality check: how much is the Dale Farm eviction costing?	19 October 2011	None
