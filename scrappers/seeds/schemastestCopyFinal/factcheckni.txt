1	CLAIM: Pet owners travelling from Northern Ireland to Ireland require “EU pet passports”.	CONCLUSION: True. This includes your pet being marked by a transponder (microchip) and vaccinated against rabies. There are presently no border checks for pets (as official policy); however it is uncertain what regulations will apply post-Brexit.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/do-northern-ireland-pets-need-passports-for-ireland/	None	brexit	None	None	None	Do Northern Ireland pets need passports for Ireland?	None	None
2	CLAIM: There are 208 border crossings between Ireland and Northern Ireland.	CONCLUSION: Unproven. It is extremely difficult to accurately establish the exact number of border crossings, as many informal routes have been established since border infrastructure was removed and many are on private land, but the official number of main routes so far identified by the Irish and Northern Ireland governments is 208.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/are-there-208-ireland-northern-ireland-border-crossings/	None	brexit	None	None	None	Are there 208 Ireland-Northern Ireland border crossings?	None	None
3	CLAIM: 60% of sales from Northern Ireland go to Great Britain.	CONCLUSION: Accurate; however the true figure is closer to 56%.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/does-northern-ireland-sell-60-of-its-goods-to-great-britain/	None	brexit	None	None	None	Does Northern Ireland sell 60% of its goods to Great Britain?

4	CLAIM: 30,000 people cross Ireland-Northern Ireland border daily.	CONCLUSION: Accurate. Indeed, this may be a low estimation, excluding train and other road journeys.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/do-30000-people-cross-ireland-northern-ireland-border-daily/	None	brexit	None	None	None	Do 30,000 people cross Ireland-Northern Ireland border daily?	None	None
5	CLAIM: The voting results from Northern Ireland of the EU referendum compels the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to call a border boll.	CONCLUSION: False. The Secretary of State may bring forth a border poll when presented with evidence that a majority of electors may choose to change the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. There has been no evidence yet published.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/must-the-sos-call-a-post-brexit-border-poll/	None	brexit	None	None	None	Must the SoS call a post-Brexit border poll?	None	None
6	CLAIM: Over a quarter of a million people migrate to the UK from the EU every year.	CONCLUSION: The claim is true, but it doesn’t include the number of people migrating from the UK to the EU: net migration in 2015 was +184,000. There is no single source that tracks migration to Northern Ireland. Medical card registrations are one method. The 2011 Census showed that 2.16% of the Northern Ireland population held an EU/EEA passport.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/what-is-eu-to-northern-ireland-net-migration/	None	brexit	None	None	None	What is EU to Northern Ireland net migration?	None	None
7	CLAIM: “City Deals” by the UK Government are part of the Democratic Unionist Party’s Confidence and Supply Agreement with the Conservative Party.	CONCLUSION: Unclear. (“False” in an earlier version of this fact check.) The DUP claim that “City Deals are part of our Confidence and Supply Agreement” is not explicitly referenced in the text of the Confidence and Supply Agreement they made with the Conservative Party, nor referenced by the Chancellor Philip Hammond in delivering his “Financial Statement” (29/10/2018). But as part of discussions between the Conservative Party and the DUP, the UK Government committed itself to working with the Northern Ireland Executive and other stakeholders towards city deals in Northern Ireland. The Belfast Regional City Deal was negotiated and agreed among Belfast City Council, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and the UK Government.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/were-city-deals-part-of-dups-confidence-and-supply-agreement/	None	economy	None	None	None	Were “City Deals” part of DUP’s Confidence and Supply Agreement?	None	None
8	CLAIM: There are 100,000 adults in Northern Ireland who have no home.	CONCLUSION: Misleading headline from estimated data. The figure is based on estimations of incomplete data and does not distinguish between statutory and “potential hidden homeless”. The majority of the estimated latter represent non-dependent (adult) children living in the parental household. More accurate data may come from collection by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive or independent research.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/are-there-100000-adults-in-northern-ireland-with-no-home/	None	economy	None	None	None	Are there 100,000 adults in Northern Ireland with no home?	None	None
9	CLAIM: There are 12,500 millionaires living in Northern Ireland.	CONCLUSION: Unproven. The information published by Barclays Wealth & Investments contains proprietary data and cannot be checked. There is also a lack of official data on wealth in Northern Ireland.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/are-there-12500-millionaires-living-in-northern-ireland/	None	economy	None	None	None	Are there 12,500 millionaires living in Northern Ireland?

11	CLAIM: All taxis can use bus lanes in many cities in Ireland and the UK.	CONCLUSION: Partly accurate. True in Ireland, but most UK cities only allow public taxis access, not private-hire cars.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/are-all-taxis-allowed-in-bus-lanes/	None	economy	None	None	None	Are all taxis allowed in bus lanes?	None	None
12	CLAIM: There was a rock fall on the Antrim coast road on 9 August 2017.	CONCLUSION: False. The image is a cropped version of one published in a local American newspaper, reporting on a rock fall that took place in Lawrence County, Ohio, on 10 April 2015.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/did-a-large-rock-fall-onto-the-antrim-coast-road/	None	economy	None	None	None	Did a large rock fall onto the Antrim coast road?	None	None
13	CLAIM: A third of Church of Ireland ministry candidates are women.	CONCLUSION: Inaccurate. A quarter of CoI accepted and enrolled candidates are women. For the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, its figures of less than 4% female candidates are considerably lower than the phrase “don’t have nearly as many women as men” would suggest. For the Methodist Church in Ireland, a third of its candidates are women.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/are-a-third-of-coi-ministry-candidates-women/	None	education	None	None	None	Are a third of CoI ministry candidates women?	None	None
14	CLAIM: “For every child coming into school in Northern Ireland, they are getting much less than their counterparts in other regions of the United Kingdom.”	CONCLUSION: Correct with consideration. Public expenditure on pre-primary and primary education in Northern Ireland is least per child (£3,440; UK average: £4,316) and per head of population (£416; UK average: £473). Meanwhile, Northern Ireland has the second highest level of expenditure on overall education per head of population (£1,453); the situation is better explained by the amount spent per head on education subsidies and n.e.c. categories (£257; UK average: £102).	https://factcheckni.org/facts/do-our-primary-pupils-receive-least-per-child/	None	education	None	None	None	Do our primary pupils receive least per child?	None	None
15	CLAIM: “…a third of young people from Northern Ireland who go to university travel outside Northern Ireland, mainly to the North West of England and Scotland, and only a third of those who graduate return back home.”	CONCLUSION: Accurate. However, the claim that “a third of young people from Northern Ireland who go to university travel outside Northern Ireland” is closer to a quarter.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/do-a-third-of-graduates-return-to-northern-ireland/	None	education	None	None	None	Do a third of graduates return to Northern Ireland?	None	None
16	CLAIM: The Irish News wrote that a funding cut places hundreds of youth work posts at risk.	CONCLUSION: There is no evidence of any cut, nor any proposed cut. Yet there is uncertainty about continued funding, for this and other programmes, in light of the composition of a new Northern Ireland Executive (or direct rule governance) after elections in March 2017.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/was-funding-cut-for-youth-work/	None	education	None	None	None	Was funding cut for youth work?	None	None
17	CLAIM: “The DUP at no point has ever agreed to establish an Irish Language Act with the UK government, with the Irish government, with Sinn Féin or anybody else.”	CONCLUSION: Accurate. The St Andrew’s Agreement committed the UK Government to an Irish Language Act, but subsequent legislation compelled the Northern Ireland Executive to produce a strategy (which may or may not include an Irish Language Act).	https://factcheckni.org/facts/thejournal-ie-did-the-dup-really-never-commit-to-an-irish-language-act/	None	education	None	None	None	TheJournal.ie: Did the DUP really never commit to an Irish Language Act?	None	None
18	CLAIM: The United Kingdom has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Europe.	CONCLUSION: True. However, the teenage pregnancy rate in Northern Ireland was the lowest within the British Isles in 2014.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/does-northern-ireland-have-a-high-teenage-pregnancy-rate/	None	education	None	None	None	Does Northern Ireland have a high teenage pregnancy rate?	None	None
21	CLAIM: Northern Ireland were once net contributors of revenue to HM Treasury.	CONCLUSION: True, up until the 1930s. But data show that Northern Ireland has run a fiscal deficit since 1966. The most recent figure, from 2013-14, is a subvention of £9.2 billion.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/how-dependent-is-stormont-on-westminster-subvention/	None	elections	None	None	None	How dependent is Stormont on Westminster subvention?	None	None
22	CLAIM: Under an Alliance Minister of Justice, crime rates in Northern Ireland are lower.	CONCLUSION: According to PSNI reports, annual offences covering the relevant period are marginally higher (105,289 versus 105,040). Meanwhile, crime in Northern Ireland has been rising every year since 2012/13.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/is-crime-on-the-rise-in-northern-ireland/	None	elections	None	None	None	Is crime on the rise in Northern Ireland?

23	CLAIM: Since 2011 the Sinn Féin Education Minister John O’Dowd has “improved educational outcomes for the most disadvantaged”, and consequently “58.5% of children receiving Free School Meals (FSM) now obtain 5 GCSEs A*-C, compared to 31.5% previously.”	CONCLUSION: The claim fails to distinguish between students that are eligible for FSM, as opposed to those who actually receive them. However, once corrected for this inaccuracy, it can be substantiated and verified by data from the Department of Education. In fact, there have been even greater improvements in performance among Free School Meal Eligible (FSME) students.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/has-sinn-fein-education-minister-improved-outcomes-for-most-disadvantaged/	None	elections	None	None	None	Has Sinn Fein Education Minister improved outcomes for most disadvantaged?	None	None
24	CLAIM: The ‘NI – Our Time, Our Place’ campaign in 2012 helped to attract 1,000,000 visitors to Northern Ireland and brought £40 million to the local economy.	CONCLUSION: This claim relies on a report by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, without research methodology or sources provided. Other evidence demonstrates a growing trend in visitor numbers. The ‘NI – Our Time, Our Place’ campaign may have made a positive contribution. However, Northern Ireland still lags behind other economies in the region.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/did-the-ni-2012-our-time-our-place-campaign-help-bring-in-one-million-visitors/	None	elections	None	None	None	Did the ‘NI 2012 – Our Time, Our Place’ campaign help bring in one million visitors?	None	None
31	CLAIM: Northern Ireland eats more meat than in the rest of the UK.	CONCLUSION: Accurate according to recent survey reports. For adults aged 19 to 64 years, the mean consumption in Northern Ireland was 82 grams per day, compared to 71 grams for all of the UK; yet for Ireland the figure is 108 grams (adults aged 18 to 64 years).	https://factcheckni.org/facts/does-northern-ireland-eat-the-most-meat/	None	facts	None	None	None	Does Northern Ireland eat the most meat?

32	CLAIM: Within the LGBT community, 25% have attempted suicide.	CONCLUSION: Accurate result in line with other surveys with LGBT respondents in the UK and Ireland. The Rainbow Project survey figure of 4% of LGBT people attempting suicide in the prior year is also consistent with surveys by other organisations.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/have-1-in-4-lgbt-persons-attempted-suicide/	None	facts	None	None	None	Have 1 in 4 LGBT persons attempted suicide?	None	None
34	CLAIM: The first time the Irish language was spoken in the House of Commons was 24 October 2018.	CONCLUSION: False. There is an official record (Hansard) of Irish spoken in the House of Commons, by Thomas O’Donnell MP, on 19 February 1901. Also, Mark Durkan MP spoke Irish in the House as recently as 17 January 2017.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/was-irish-spoken-for-the-first-time-in-the-house-of-commons/	None	facts	None	None	None	Was Irish spoken for the first time in the House of Commons?

35	CLAIM: One in five new constables from 2016 and 2017 are from a Catholic community background.	CONCLUSION: Unproven but accurate for years 2013 to 2015.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/are-one-in-five-psni-new-constables-catholic/	None	facts	None	None	None	Are one in five PSNI new constables Catholic?

41	CLAIM: Figures published ahead of the Irish referendum on abortion show only 43 women came from Ireland to have an abortion in England last year.	CONCLUSION: Incorrect. 3,265 women living in Ireland came to England and Wales for an abortion in 2016. 43 refers to the reported number of women from one hospital who came to the UK so far in 2017.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/full-fact-how-many-women-leave-northern-ireland-to-have-an-abortion-in-britain/	None	health	None	None	None	Full Fact: How many women leave Northern Ireland to have an abortion in Britain?	None	None
42	CLAIM: Northern Ireland is the happiest region in the UK.	CONCLUSION: The majority of people surveyed by ONS indicated being majority happy with their lives. However, statistically, Northern Ireland has some of the highest rates of mental health illness in the UK and some research has found quality of life to be low here. Most citizens are happy but there exists serious issues which detract from well-being.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/is-northern-ireland-the-happiest-part-of-the-uk/	None	health	None	None	None	Is Northern Ireland the happiest part of the UK?	None	None
46	CLAIM: In Northern Ireland, more people speak Polish than speak Irish.	CONCLUSION: Mostly false. While the 2011 Census data show more people in Northern Ireland speaking Polish than Irish as their main language, based on other available data it is implausible that there are more who speak Polish than Irish.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/thejournal-ie-are-there-really-more-polish-speakers-than-irish-speakers-in-northern-ireland/	None	immigration	None	None	None	TheJournal.ie: Are there really more Polish speakers than Irish speakers in Northern Ireland?

48	CLAIM: “The health service in Northern Ireland will especially benefit from the requirement for foreigners – including those from the Republic of Ireland – to pay for hospital treatment.” – Sammy Wilson, Belfast Telegraph, 19 May 2016	CONCLUSION: The claim, while technically accurate, is misleading. Under a variety of different circumstances, foreigners do pay for access to health care already. The proposed legislation would seek ways to extend the scope for foreigners to contribute financially for NHS services, and to increase the incentives for debt recovery. The NHS would save significantly by simply collecting on what it is owed under current exchange schemes with foreign governments.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/are-foreigners-a-financial-strain-on-the-nhs-in-northern-ireland/	None	immigration	None	None	None	Are foreigners a financial strain on the NHS in Northern Ireland?	None	None
50	CLAIM: Only the Irish language is banned in courts in Northern Ireland.	CONCLUSION: False. English is the working language of court proceedings in Northern Ireland; interpretation and translation services are provided for those who do not speak or understand English. Whether this policy is informed by the Penal Laws is currently contested.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/is-irish-the-only-language-banned-in-northern-ireland-courts/	None	law	None	None	None	Is Irish the only language banned in Northern Ireland courts?

51	CLAIM: Over 29,000 incidents of domestic violence and abuse took place in Northern Ireland in 2017.

53	CLAIM: There is a high level of public support for restorative justice as a method of dealing with young offenders.	CONCLUSION: According to surveys collected by NISRA and by the Public Prosecution Service, a majority of respondents support either restorative justice or diversionary options generally.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/is-there-a-high-level-of-support-for-restorative-justice/	None	law	None	None	None	Is there a high level of support for restorative justice?

54	CLAIM: “Almost half of criminals released from prison in Northern Ireland went on to re-offend within 12 months of being freed.”	CONCLUSION: The claim is accurate. However, while the article does break down re-offending rates among criminals released from prison, the majority of offenders receive sentences that do not require time in prison. The re-offending rate for Northern Ireland in 2012/13 was 18.5% for all offenders, which is similar to the rate documented in previous years, as well as in England & Wales.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/do-half-of-freed-criminals-reoffend-within-a-year/	None	law	None	None	None	Do half of freed criminals reoffend within a year?

60	CLAIM: Progressive Politics NI claimed that MLAs were paid “nearly £2.2 million” in salaries up to 3rd September 2017.	CONCLUSION: Broadly accurate. The annual salary of an MLA is £49,500. For the period covered by the claim (13/3-13/9/2017), MLAs received a combined estimate of £2,333,188.	https://factcheckni.org/facts/how-much-do-mlas-earn-or-not/	None	peace	None	None	None	How much do MLAs earn (or not)?
