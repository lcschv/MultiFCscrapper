1_1	“The ACT Party has put three strikes into law, and it’s taken the worst offenders off the street, and that’s what New Zealanders wanted, and we’ve delivered.”	Mostly Fiction	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201856797/fact-or-fiction-the-nation-s-minor-parties-debate	This claim is true to the extent that the three strikes law has been applied a number of times. But here are the details: No captionPhoto: RNZ / Claire Eastham-Farrelly The three strikes rule, or the Sentencing and Parole Reform Act 2010, implemented a three-stage process of increasing consequences for repeat serious offenders. There are 40 qualifying offences which cover all of the major violent and sexual offences, with a maximum penalty of at least seven years imprisonment. These include murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, a large range of sexual offences, and other violent offences. The first time a qualifying offence is committed, a first warning is issued. This results in conviction for that offence and this stays on the offender’s record unless it is overturned. A second qualifying offence results in a final warning, which means that if the offender is sentenced to imprisonment they must serve their full sentence with no possibility for parole. If convicted of a third qualifying offence, the maximum penalty for the offence must be imposed, unless a judge considers that to be 'manifestly unjust'. According to Ministry of Justice data, since the introduction of the three strikes rule in 2010 up until June 2017, 8503 people have received first warnings, 216 people have received final warnings (ie a second strike) requiring them to serve their full sentence, and two people have been convicted of a third qualifying offence (ie received a third strike).

1_2	When Māori are incarcerated - 27 times more likely for the same crime than non-Māori - then we are putting and locking away our people in a racist system, and you say, ‘Bang. Sorry about it.	Inconclusive	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201856797/fact-or-fiction-the-nation-s-minor-parties-debate	The prison population for Māori is about six times higher than what would be expected, based on the proportion of Māori in New Zealand’s overall population. The rates are also higher than should be expected for young Māori. Among 10- to 16-year-olds, the rate of young Māori charged in court is about three times higher than the general rate, and they accounted for 64 percent (nearly two thirds) of all young people charged in court. However, RNZ has been unable to find any evidence that unequivocally proves or disproves the claim that Māori are 27 times more likely to be imprisoned on a crime-by-crime basis. Here is a report on the over-representation of Māori in the criminal justice system.

Firstly, Mana’s website states: “All immigrants shall be required to accept that they may be required to live in a particular part of Aotearoa for the first 10 years.” While it is not clear that Mana would direct immigrants to the regions, the policy certainly allows for this to happen. Secondly, Mana does specifically mention Pasifika immigrants multiple times in their immigration policy on the website. It says that Pasifika families affected by climate change will be the first priority in terms of refugees. It also says that immigration shall be reviewed annually based on a number of factors, including 'Pacific requirements'.

2_2	There's 200,000 houses going to be built in New Zealand over the next six years.	Fact	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201857236/fact-or-fiction-do-the-leaders-know	According to Statistics New Zealand, in the year to 30 June 2017, 30,453 homes were consented across New Zealand. If this rate is maintained exactly over the next six years, 182,718 homes will be consented – 17,282 less than Mr English states. However, MBIE’s National Construction Pipeline Report for 2017 estimated that residential consents will steadily grow from 30,453 homes to a peak of 34,500 homes per year in 2019. If that is the case, then it is likely around 200,000 homes will be consented over the next six years, from 2017-2023. It is probable Mr English is anticipating the rate to increase in accordance with heightened demand for housing, as New Zealand’s population is expected to grow to 5.01 – 5.51 million in 2025. If New Zealand achieves its highest ever recorded rate of consents of 40,000 homes per year in early 1974, it will go far beyond this 200,000 houses goal. One important caveat: just because a house is consented, does not meant the house gets constructed. Experimental statistics published by Statistics NZ earlier this year concluded that 97 percent of house consented do eventually get built, within 10 months on average. However, over the past year Auckland Council has been developing a database of dwelling completions - the only local authority to do so. The latest monthly data puts the annual completion rate at 6,827 - despite an annual consent rate of about 10,000 houses.

2_3	Jacinda Ardern: "Housing affordability is the worst we've seen in such a long time, that we've had..." Bill English (interrupting): "That's not true... Housing affordability is better than in 2008."	Its complicated	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201857236/fact-or-fiction-do-the-leaders-know	Presumably, Bill English is referring to the Massey Home Affordability Index, which compares the average weekly earnings with the median dwelling price and the mortgage interest rate. In May 2017 the national index was 24.55 compared with 32.92 in May 2008. The higher the index number, the less affordable homes are, so by the index measure, homes are more affordable in 2017 than 2008. But relying on this index alone is problematic because the urban housing markets of Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga and Wellington (where roughly half the country’s population live) have grown considerably in value compared to the rest of the country. It’s also important to note that the Massey Index factors in interests rates that were over 10 percent in the lead-up to the Global Financial Crisis, and at present they hover about six percent. Also, this index does not take into account the ability to obtain mortgages. Since October 2013, a loan-to-value ratio restriction imposed by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand requires most residential mortgage holders to hold at least a 20 percent deposit, which has proved to be the biggest barrier to home ownership since then. The median house price in Auckland is about $800,000, while 'affordable' housing usually been set at about $550,000 in most special housing areas - meaning a deposit of at least $110,000. That compares to the zero deposit mortgages some banks were offering in 2008, prior to the GFC.	Elections	Bill English	None	None	Fact or Fiction: Do the leaders know?	4 September 2017	None

3_1	There's an $11.7 billion hole in Labour's budget	Fiction	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201857321/fact-or-fiction-fiscal-holes-and-child-poverty	National has taken issue with Labour's alternative budget on several counts, but the biggest and most important is that Labour has not included the extra money it wants to spend in its operating allowance in subsequent years. Steven Joyce claims this is where most of the gap comes from. Several economists have roundly rejected National's claims. Labour finance spokesperson Grant Robertson (left) and leader Andrew Little, at the party's launch of its budget plan. Labour finance spokesperson Grant Robertson with the party's budget plan Photo: RNZ / Jane Patterson Economic commentator Brian Fallow has told Checkpoint with John Campbell that the disagreement over the figures is a matter of interpretation. National's budget includes an $11.7bn operating allowance (essentially, a slush fund of unallocated spending). Labour's is just $4.5bn - but that doesn't mean $7bn has disappeared, Fallow says. Instead, Labour has allocated that money to the budget lines it intends to spend it on - mostly health, education, and increased paid parental leave and other provisions in its Families Package. Total Crown operating expenses are $440bn in National's budget and $448bn in Labour's budget - and the $8bn difference is mostly covered by the $7.4bn Labour gets by cancelling National's planned tax cuts. BERL chief economist Ganesh Nana - whose organisation reviewed Labour's alternative budget - agrees with Fallow's assessment. It is different to the way the National-led government treated the operating allowance, but it is not wrong or a mistake, Nana says: "From an accountant's perspective it makes sense."

3_2	Labour and National's pledge to lift 100,000 children out of poverty	Pick a number, any number.	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201857321/fact-or-fiction-fiscal-holes-and-child-poverty	The Ministry of Social Development's Household Incomes Report defines child poverty as being in a household earning less than 60 percent of the median income after housing costs. Within that, there are two ways of looking at the figures. The 'moving line' measure uses relative income - if the median rises, then so does the poverty line. Using this measure, 295,000 children were living in poverty in 2015, the most recent year for which there are figures. The 'moving line' can be misleading because if median incomes worsen - due to an economic crash, for example - then it would show poverty decreasing because the median income would fall. The second measure uses an 'anchored line' based on 2007 median incomes. On this basis, the number of children living in poverty was 230,000 in 2015. No captionPhoto: RNZ / Alexander Robertson Confused yet? Wait, there's more! Jacinda Ardern used yet another measure this morning when she pledged that Labour would lift 100,000 children out of poverty by 2020 - basing her pledge on the number of children living in households earning less than 50 percent of the median income after housing costs, instead of 60 percent. By that measure, there were either 210,000 children in poverty in 2015 (if you use the moving line figure) or 160,000 children (using the anchored line figure). Both of those figures are different to the 290,000 children Ms Ardern said were living in poverty during Newshub's leaders debate (which seems to be based on the less-than-60-percent after-housing-costs 'moving line' figure). If Labour is committing to the less than 50 percent of median income figure, we would expect to see that number fall from 210,000 to 110,000 by 2020. But that could still leave the number of kids leaving in households earning less than 60 percent of the median income (MSD's own measure) unchanged. Whew, okay - onto National. Bill English disputed Ms Ardern's 290,000 figure (which is slightly off MSD's own 295,000 figure). But he did not provide his own figure, and - crucially - he did not state which of the many measures he would be using as a baseline for his own pledge. So we know how many children Mr English wants to lift out of 'poverty' - but not how many that will still leave behind.

4	Share this Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share via email Share on Google Plus Share on Reddit Share on Linked In National says middle income earners will lose $1000 a year under a Labour government. Fact or Fiction puts that claim to the test.	Fact in some circumstances, fiction in others.	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201857491/fact-or-fiction-the-dollar1000-question	Under National’s proposed tax reforms, due to kick in on 1 April next year, people on incomes above $52,000 (about the median individual income) will gain $20.38 per week as income tax thresholds rise - an annual tax cut of $1060. Under Labour, income earners will not get this tax cut as the income tax thresholds will remain the same. In this sense, National's claim is true, although technically, income earners don't 'lose' $1000, because they're already paying it in tax at the moment - they just won't gain it back under Labour. However, National’s statement ignores Labour’s families package, which Jacinda Ardern says would leave most families better off compared to National’s tax cuts. So where does that leave National's claim? Labour's package includes changes to Working For Families that would increase the amount eligible families receive in tax credits and also extend the scheme to more families. For a two-child (primary school-age) family with an annual household income of $90,000 or less, the extra Working For Families tax credits they would receive under Labour would offset the loss of National's tax cut - and in many cases would actually leave them better off. For a two-child family earning more than $90,000, the extra tax credits would not match what they would get from National's tax cuts. If the family earned over $100,000, they would not get anything at all under Labour. The formula changes again for families with very young children, who would receive Labour's $60 per week BestStart payment. And a family with three or more children could earn in excess of $110,000 and receive more under Labour's families package than they would from National's tax cuts.

5_1	National’s promise to increase the number of elective surgeries to 200,000 is bizarre, given Jonathan Coleman has claimed 200,000 electives are already being performed.	Fact	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201857606/fact-or-fiction-which-health-claims-are-quackery	Is National setting itself a target it's already achieved? RNZ asked Labour for its source material, which were Ministry of Health elective surgery documents provided under the Official Information Act. Fact or Fiction has ignored Labour's commentary around the OIA material and only used the raw data to assess this and the following claim. No captionJonathan Coleman Photo: RNZ / Rebekah Parsons-King Since the 2015/16 year, the Ministry of Health has monitored two sets of elective surgery figures: elective surgical discharges (i.e. completed elective surgeries); and elective surgical discharges and 'arranged' surgical discharges (same-same-but-different to elective surgery). The second set of figures is the one currently used to report on the government's much-touted 'more elective surgery' health target. In the 2015/16 year, the target was 200,460 elective surgeries - Jonathan Coleman said in Parliament that this target had been met. In his press release announcing National would 'lift' the number of elective surgeries from 174,000 to 200,000 by 2021/22, Dr Coleman appears to be using the first, older definition - which the Ministry of Health still measures, but does not use as the target it sets for district health boards to meet.

5_2	It turns out nearly all the so-called increase in electives have been due to re-classifying minor outpatient procedures like eye injections and skin lesion removals as electives.	Mostly Fiction	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201857606/fact-or-fiction-which-health-claims-are-quackery	Since the 2011/12 year, the Ministry of Health has included Avastin (eye) injections to treat worsening sight, and skin lesion removal/treatment in its elective surgery figures. Jonathan Coleman defended the inclusion of these procedures in Parliament last year, and the Ministry of Health has said one of the reasons for changing the definition was to bring it into line with international practice. The ministry also confirmed to Fact or Fiction that some of these procedures may have previously been counted as general surgery or opthalmology procedures (and therefore been included in the overall figure before 2011/12 anyway). So, bearing all that in mind, Fact or Fiction believes the fairest way to assess David Clark's claim is to look at where the increase in elective surgeries has come from since the ministry started counting these procedures separately. In that time, overall elective surgeries (using the old definition, as the ministry didn't provide a detailed breakdown for the new definition) have increased by 18,500. Of these, about 6900 were Avastin injections or skin lesions. So these two groups of procedures account for about 37 percent of the increase - "nearly all" is a bit of a stretch. For the most recent year figures are available, Labour's claim holds up though - out of 4116 additonal electives in 2015/16, more than three-quarters (77 percent) were Avastin injections or skin lesions.

Of those, it is correct that about 60,000 people had their referral declined (and another 10,000 were declined because their GP didn't provide enough information - they may well have re-applied and been accepted in a subsequent month). Of those who were declined, about 27,000 (46 percent) were turned down because they didn't meet the threshold - basically, the level of seriousness your condition has to reach before you can get a specialist appointment. The Ministry of Health defines this category as patients where "the referral is appropriate and the patient would benefit from an assessment but the referral is below the DHB's capacity threshold". So, those 27,000 people needed an appointment but missed out, because our health system couldn't afford it or couldn't cope with that demand. Another 29,000 (50 percent) were turned down because specialist services assessed their referrals and decided that a specialist appointment was "not required" - either because they didn't need an appointment, or their condition could be treated by a GP, or the appointment was unlikely to benefit them.

The foundation based this on information obtained from the Department of Corrections through a recent official information request, which shows an average of seven people per year are imprisoned for possession of marijuana (as their only offence). It is unlikely that all seven are in prison at one time. About 150 people were imprisoned in 2016 with a cannabis charge (possession for supply, etc) as their most serious offence.

What Mr Seymour is apparently referring to is a series of Māori language recovery programmes that began in the 1980s, targeted at young people and the education system – such as kōhanga reo (immersing pre-schoolers in the Māori language) and kura kaupapa (schooling in a Māori language environment). This had come after years of lobbying by Māori activists, who highlighted 1985 statistics showing that only about 12 percent of the Māori population (50,000 people out of the total population at the time) were fluent in Te Reo. This should be compared to 1919 statistics, in which 99 percent of Māori school children were native speakers. Te Reo Māori was only declared to be an official language of New Zealand in 1987. Maori Language WeekChildren celebrate Te Wiki o Te Reo in 2016 Photo: RNZ / Rebekah Parsons-King According to the Health of the Māori Language Survey, after extensive work to re-establish the language (such as government funding for a Māori television channel, and community Māori language initiatives), the number of Māori who had “some Māori speaking skills” had risen to 136,700 speakers in 2001. However, only 13 percent of this population aged over 15 could read Te Reo “well” or “very well”, according to the same survey. A later survey in 2006 found the number who could read Te Reo “well” or "very well” had increased significantly to 23 percent. While proficiency in Te Reo was highest for the oldest Māori, the second highest age group was for 15 to 24-year-olds – indicating that Māori language teaching in schools, was, in fact, helping to revitalise the language. While the total proportion of the Māori population able to converse “well” in Te Reo dropped to 21 percent in the 2013 Census, the higher proportions of younger speakers in 2006 indicate the introduction of Te Reo in schools was a help, rather than a hindrance, to the survival of the Māori language. However, if Mr Seymour meant that Te Reo was "lost" through making English language compulsory in schools (and banning Te Reo), he was correct - as the statistics from 1919-1985 highlight a drop from 99 percent fluency to merely 12 percent.

Superannuation is taxed at the same rate as regular wages, and in most scenarios, this ends up being an effective tax rate of 13-14 percent. In 2013, the after-tax cost of superannuation was $8.8 billion, compared to a before-tax cost of $10.2bn - again, an overall 14 percent gap.

Fiction	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201858316/fact-or-fiction-a-superannuation-special	Using the figures in this University of Auckland report (again, using 2013 numbers), New Zealand's GDP is expected to actually nearly quadruple by 2050 - from $265bn to $1002bn. In that same time, though, the cost of superannuation (after tax) is estimated to rise to $61bn - meaning it will account for 6.1 percent of GDP. If GDP only doubled, then superannuation would account for 11.5 percent of that.	Elections	Winston Peters	None	None	Fact or Fiction: A superannuation special	13 September 2017	None
7_5	This can only happen if the population is not artificially inflated by mass immigration. We cannot continue to take in net 73,000 new immigrants a year – enough for a city the size of Rotorua - as we are now doing.	Mostly Fiction	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201858316/fact-or-fiction-a-superannuation-special	It's correct that superannuation would cost a lot more than the estimates above if New Zealand's net migration did continue at current record levels. However, Statistics NZ's population projections (which are then used by Treasury and other government departments to cost policies, such as the future cost of superannuation) show very little difference between the number of over-65s we would have living here by 2058 if very high migration continued, or if migration continued at the long-term historical average. We would end up with an extra 58,000 pensioners (total) if high migration continued - eligible for about $1.1b in superannuation between them each year.

8	I just don’t want to hit them with a $50,000 or $100,000 tax just because David Parker and the Labour Party think so.	Fiction	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201858627/fact-or-fiction-running-the-numbers-on-water	Fact or Fiction has run the following answer past a Lincoln University source to ensure our assumptions and calculations are correct. The examples are based on averages - it is important to note that irrigation requirements will vary from region to region, and even between farms. We have used Dairy NZ's figures on both farm size and irrigation water requirements, here and here. Two dairy farmers - one from the Waikato, one from the Wairarapa - confirmed to Fact or Fiction that they would use a little less water for irrigation than Dairy NZ suggests, but we have stuck with the Dairy NZ figures. Labour has suggested a charge of one to two cents per 1000 litres of water used - we have used two cents. If Labour went with a one-cent tax, the following costs would halve. First up, a dairy farmer, farming on 144 hectares (the average size), requiring 4mm of irrigation a day over a 120-day irrigating season (assuming it's particularly dry). For every hectare of land, you need to use 10,000L of water to get 1mm of coverage - a cost of 20c/mm, per hectare. For 4mm of coverage, the cost would be 80c per hectare, per day. Over 120 days, assuming full irrigation for every one of those days, the cost for the entire farm would be just over $13,800. Based on an average herd size of 413 cows, each drinking 130L of water a day, you'd pay another $391 each year. To get to a figure of $50,000, you would need to have a very large farm - well over 500 hectares - or be irrigating at three to four times the suggested rate. For a produce grower, with an average 20-hectare farm, requiring 17mm of irrigation each week over an irrigation period of 13 weeks, the cost per year would be $884, or thereabouts.

9_1	The justice sector forecast for 2015-2025 said that the prison population was likely to increase to 10,090 by 2025… Well that actually happened in less than one year after the report was released.	Fact	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201859218/fact-or-fiction-how-correct-are-corrections-claims	Kelvin Davis was referring to the Ministry of Justice’s Justice Sector Forecast, released in December 2015, which did forecast a rise in the prison population from 9150 in 2015 to 10,090 by 2025. It is also true that the prison population grew far faster than anticipated by the ministry. As of June 2017, the prison population is at 10,260 - higher than it was predicted to be in 2025. However, in December 2016, which was one year after the report was released - Mr Davis’s reference point - the prison population was 9914. This is slightly less than the 10,090 by December 2016 that Mr Davis claimed, yet it is still a considerable increase compared to the predicted rate of increase.

Mostly Fact	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201859218/fact-or-fiction-how-correct-are-corrections-claims	Corrections figures show 38 percent of prisoners were jailed for violent offences, 20 percent for sexual offences, and 13 percent for drugs and anti-social behaviour - a total of 71 percent. The definition of the latter category includes drug use and possession, disorder and vagrancy - unlikely to be considered "serious offenders" - so Ms Upston's 71 percent figure may capture some of those less serious charges.

9_4	The prison population has been rising under Labour and National… We’ll be at twice the OECD average by 2027, according to our projections.	Fiction	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201859218/fact-or-fiction-how-correct-are-corrections-claims	The Opportunities Party co-deputy leader Geoff Simmons (in a video on the party's Facebook page) The prison population in New Zealand actually dipped slightly between 2011 and 2013. Increases since 2013 can largely be attributed to changes in the Bail Act & Sentencing Act. The Bail Act placed tougher conditions on those seeking bail, while also limiting which offences would qualify for bail. Changes to the Sentencing Act were introduced to ensure all victims were offered restorative justice prior to their sentencing. These changes have meant an overall higher proportion of prisoners are remanded in custody (kept in prison while their case is going through the courts) at any given time, as an overall percentage of the total prisoner population. At the top end of projections, the Ministry of Justice has forecast that prison numbers will likely increase by about 19 percent by the 2025/26 year. Inside Paremoremo PrisonPhoto: RNZ / Claire Eastham-Farrelly New Zealand’s total number of incarcerated persons are the seventh highest per capita in the OECD at a rate of 210 prisoners per 100,000 people, while the OECD average hovers around 140 per 100,000 people. Using the ministry's projections, the imprisonment rate would rise to 232 per 100,000 (accounting for a general population increase) by 2025/26 - about 66 percent higher than the current OECD average but not double. The ministry has not published its projections for the 2027 year.	Elections	Geoff Simmons	None	None	Fact or Fiction: How correct are corrections claims?	20 September 2017	None
9_5	Each prisoner we lock up costs $100,000 per year	Fact	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201859218/fact-or-fiction-how-correct-are-corrections-claims	Corrections' annual report says a sentenced prisoner costs the department $307.53 per day. The same report puts the cost of a remand prisoner at $239.17 per day. The main reason for this difference is because sentenced prisoners generally have longer unlock hours, more case management and a series of mandated programmes such to attend. The same report gives an average population of 6816 sentence prisoners and 2377 remand prisoners. The weighted average cost therefore works out at $105,809 per prisoner, per year.
