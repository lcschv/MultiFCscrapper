1	 Crime guns are “often stolen or illegally diverted or smuggled in from the United States.”	FactsCan Score: True	http://factscan.ca/bill-blair-crime-guns/	While the data on this topic is limited and somewhat flawed, experts agree that historically, most crime guns in Canada have arrived unlawfully from the US. Some new reports contradict this view and imply that a higher rate of crime guns are domestically sourced, however, these reports show that domestic crime guns have been illegally diverted (straw purchases), as opposed to being legally owned by the perpetrators.

2	 The Canada Child Benefit has lifted “nearly 300,000 children” out of poverty	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/esdc-canada-child-benefit/	The number of children lifted out of poverty by the Canada Child Benefit won’t be known until 2019. The government is still relying on the projected impacts of the CCB and not on survey data.	None	ESDC	None	None	None	2018-10-04	gust 20, 2018
3	 “Canada’s unemployment rate is at its lowest level since the 1970s.”	FactsCan Score: True	http://factscan.ca/justin-trudeau-unemployment-rate-lowest-level/	This is true, but it’s not the first time. Canada’s lowest unemployment rate since the 1970s is 5.8 per cent. Recently, monthly unemployment rates – in December 2017 as well as February-July 2018 – have dipped to 5.8 per cent. Ten years ago and for a shorter period, in October 2007, the rate fell to the same low.	None	Justin Trudeau	None	None	None	2018-09-21	gust 14, 2018
4	 “This government committed to ending fossil fuel subsidies.”	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/jagmeet-singh-fossil-fuel-subsidies/	The commitment to end fossil fuel subsidies appears in a 2015 statement by leaders of the Group of 20 countries including Canada under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and an earlier G20 statement from a 2009 summit. Implementing the G20 commitment is also in the Liberal election platform from 2015. The commitment, however, is about phasing out fossil fuel subsidies over the medium term to 2025. 	None	Jagmeet Singh	None	None	None	2018-09-13	June 23, 2018
5	 “Tax exemptions given to web giants … cost Canadians nearly $1B every year in lost tax revenue.”	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/ndp-tax-exemptions-web-giants/	The “tax exemption” at the center of this check is about the collection of sales taxes. Because tax laws were written before online sales, foreign web companies don’t always have to collect taxes like domestic counterparts do. If collected, those taxes may equal $1 billion or more. However, the claim omits that the taxes in question would be paid by Canadians, and we find that misleading. 	None	NDP	None	None	None	2018-09-03	pril 15, 2018
6	 The Liberals offered “classes for returning terrorists in poetry and podcasting, not to mention cheques for $10 million.”	FactsCan Score: False	http://factscan.ca/pierre-paul-hus-poetry-and-podcasting/	The government does provide funding for at least one program that uses podcasting and poetry to help prevent radicalization. However, the program at issue, developed by Project SOMEONE, is not offered to returning fighters.	None	Pierre Paul-Hus	None	None	None	2018-06-28	 May 11, 2018
7	 “Trudeau’s carbon tax will raise gas prices by 11 cents/litre.”	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/andrew-scheer-carbon-tax/	Gas prices are projected to rise by 11 cents per litre by 2022 in provinces and territories without their own carbon pricing systems. However, the federal carbon tax likely won’t apply in BC, Alberta, Ontario, or Quebec. These provinces already have their own carbon pricing systems in place. Gas prices will likely increase a few cents in those provinces in order to align with federal carbon pricing standards, but that increase won’t reach 11 cents. 	None	Andrew Scheer	None	None	None	2018-05-21	arch 29, 2018
8	 “While the unemployment rate might be decreasing, the kinds of new jobs created in Canada are part-time.”	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/ndp-part-time-jobs/	The latest job figures show that full-time work is growing more than part-time work in recent months in 2018 and in 2017, compared to the month or year before. There is longer-term and older data that show part-time work has driven total employment growth, but it’s misleading to make a claim about “new jobs” and ignore the latest data.	None	NDP	None	None	None	2018-04-27	None
9	 “Any decision by the B.C. government to limit the flow of bitumen would be outside the province’s jurisdiction.”	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/kim-rudd-pipeline-jurisdiction/	The federal government does control interprovincial pipelines. However, provincial governments have shared control of related matters like environmental protection. This means both the federal and provincial governments could potentially impose regulations on a project like the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. Depending on arguments made by B.C. in an upcoming legal case, there’s at least a chance the courts will find the province has jurisdiction to limit bitumen flow in some capacity.

10	 “In total, this week’s trip has yielded more than $1 billion in investment between Canada and India.”	FactsCan Score: False	http://factscan.ca/justin-trudeau-1-billion/	The agreements totaling $1 billion did not happen because of Justin Trudeau’s week-long trip to India. Some investment announcements coincided with the trip, but the deals behind the majority of the investment figure were signed or proposed weeks to months before. Plus, attributing long-term investment to a single state visit is shaky logic. 	None	Justin Trudeau	None	None	None	2018-03-11	uary 22, 2018
11	 “When other ministers were found to have broken the rules, they had to pay the money back.”	FactsCan Score: True	http://factscan.ca/andrew-scheer-pay-back/	While ministers are not always legally required to pay back costs when they’re found to have contravened conflicts laws, there is an informal precedent for paying back such costs. Even public officials who were not formally found breaking the rules have reimbursed taxpayers, including for some travel costs.	None	Andrew Scheer	None	None	None	2018-03-09	ruary 6, 2018
12	 “I … accepted all the Commissioner’s advice and recommendations.”	FactsCan Score: Withholding Judgement	http://factscan.ca/justin-trudeau-recommendations/	Advice from the Ethics Commissioner to the Prime Minister is confidential, and therefore this claim can’t be verified. Here’s what we do know: Following release of an ethics report on the Prime Minister’s vacation to a private island owned by the Aga Khan, former Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson privately issued at least one recommendation and publicly issued another, both of which Trudeau said he will follow. The report itself does not include recommendations.	None	Justin Trudeau	None	None	None	2018-03-02	ruary 6, 2018
13	 “Omar Khadr didn’t apologize.”	FactsCan Score: False	http://factscan.ca/conservative-party-omar-khadr-apology/	Omar Khadr apologized to the widow of Christopher Speer, the U.S. soldier killed in Afghanistan in a disputed firefight, at a military commission trial in Guantanamo Bay in 2010. More recently, he apologized to the Speer family for any pain caused by talk of a settlement with the Canadian government. 	None	Conservative Party	None	None	None	2017-07-27	 July 7, 2017
14	 “The payout to Omar Khadr was a choice made by Justin Trudeau.”	FactsCan Score: True	http://factscan.ca/andrew-scheer-omar-khadr-settlement/	The government had a choice to settle Khadr’s lawsuit or fight it in court. However, according to a few experts, going to court might make political sense but not practical sense. Khadr’s lawsuit followed a Supreme Court decision that found Canadian officials participated in keeping him detained in a foreign prison system that violated his human rights.

15	 The Canada Child Benefit “has lifted hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty.”	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/ginette-petitpas-taylor-ccb/	The number of children lifted out of poverty by the Canada Child Benefit won’t be known until late 2017 or early 2018.	None	Ginette Petitpas Taylor	None	None	None	2017-07-23	June 19, 2017
16	 “We’ve got just as many young girls in our caucus as any.”	FactsCan Score: False	http://factscan.ca/don-plett-diversity/	Women make up a smaller number and share of Conservative senators than other groups in the Senate. The Independent Senators Group has the largest number and share of women.	None	Don Plett	None	None	None	2017-06-18	mber 23, 2016
17	 “Detain, question, and return – it’s that simple.”	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/kellie-leitch-detain-question-and-return/	Under Canadian law, it’s not always possible to detain or remove irregular border crossers from Canada. Detention and removal can happen, but with many steps in between. It’s not so simple as “detain, question, and return.”	None	Kellie Leitch	None	None	None	2017-05-30	pril 14, 2017
18	 “The US has a $400-million dairy surplus with Canada.”	FactsCan Score: True	http://factscan.ca/justin-trudeau-dairy-surplus/	The United States sold $376 million more in dairy products to Canada than it purchased in 2016. But a trade surplus isn’t an indicator of more or less open trade. No conclusions can be made about which country is more protectionist using this figure alone. 	None	Justin Trudeau	None	None	None	2017-05-14	pril 20, 2017
19	 The TPP “allows corporations from 11 different countries to sue Canada whenever our government passes a law that hurts their profits.”	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/paul-manly-tpp-profits/	The TPP does allow foreign investors to sue Canada, but not for profit loss alone. Companies must show that Canada breached one of its treaty commitments, which resulted in lost profit.	None	Paul Manly	None	None	None	2017-05-10	None
20	 “Canada spends $12 billion a year on oil from Saudi Arabia.”	FactsCan Score: False	http://factscan.ca/kevin-oleary-saudi-oil/	Canada spends on average $2.2 billion a year on Saudi oil, according to Statistics Canada.	None	Kevin O’Leary	None	None	None	2017-04-27	uary 18, 2017
21	 Canada’s emissions target is “incompatible with the Paris Agreement”	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/elizabeth-may-incompatible-target/	Canada’s target is allowed by the terms of the agreement. But to meet the agreement’s goal of limiting global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius or less, Canada and all countries combined need higher targets.	None	Elizabeth May	None	None	None	2017-04-02	mber 19, 2016
22	 “Taxes were lowered for middle-class Canadians.”	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/bill-morneau-middle-class-canadians/	The Liberal government and key departments refuse to clearly define who’s in the “middle class,” so can’t claim to benefit them.	None	Bill Morneau	None	None	None	2017-01-18	mber 14, 2016
23	 The national security watchdog committee can go “wherever the evidence takes them.”	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/ralph-goodale-wherever-the-evidence-takes-them/	The new committee can track evidence across different departments and agencies. But there are limits on the type of information the committee can access.	None	Ralph Goodale	None	None	None	2016-11-07	tober 3, 2016
24	 Tom Mulcair “changed his mind, and he wants us to use our majority to ram through electoral change.”	FactsCan Score: False	http://factscan.ca/justin-trudeau-tom-mulcair-changed-his-mind/	Mulcair has been consistent that all parties should be involved in introducing a new voting system.  	None	Justin Trudeau	None	None	None	2016-10-27	ober 19, 2016
25	 Australian voters have “ballots the size of dorm-room posters.”	FactsCan Score: True	http://factscan.ca/rona-ambrose-dorm-room-poster-ballots/	Many Australians voted with a ballot measuring over one metre in length to elect senators during the July 2016 election. Ballots for the House of Representatives (equivalent to Canada’s House of Commons), were closer to the size of a leaflet, or roughly the same as Canadian ballots. 	None	Rona Ambrose	None	None	None	2016-10-14	mber 26, 2016
26	 HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons) “are tens of thousands of times more polluting than carbon dioxide.”	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/catherine-mckenna-hfcs/	Not all hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are created equal. Some are more harmful than others. On average, HFCs are thousands of times worse for global warming than carbon dioxide. Not “tens of thousands” as McKenna claimed.	None	Catherine McKenna	None	None	None	2016-10-03	June 26, 2016
27	 Young women “account for a shocking 74 per cent of all new HIV infections among adolescents in Africa.”	FactsCan Score: True	http://factscan.ca/justin-trudeau-young-women-hiv-infections/	Data from UNAIDS and UNICEF shows that young girls aged 10 to 19 in sub-Saharan Africa are significantly more vulnerable to HIV infection than their male peers due to a variety of economic and gender-related factors.	None	Justin Trudeau	None	None	None	2016-09-10	gust 25, 2016
28	 “We know that people are going to spend [child benefit income] on healthier groceries, on school supplies, on summer camp for kids.”	FactsCan Score: True	http://factscan.ca/justin-trudeau-child-benefit-spending/	Research on how Canadians spend child tax benefits suggests the money goes to things that enhance children’s wellbeing like food, education, and recreation. 	None	Justin Trudeau	None	None	None	2016-08-12	July 20, 2016
29	 Barack Obama’s reference to Canada doing its “full share” not a call to increase defence spending	FactsCan Score: False	http://factscan.ca/harjit-sajjan-nato-full-share/	Harjit Sajjan suggested that Barack Obama’s recent comment on Canada contributing its “full share” to NATO did not refer to a NATO guideline on overall defence spending. But the Defence Minister’s interpretation is not very persuasive, and similar comments made elsewhere by Obama clearly reference the spending target. 	None	Harjit Sajjan	None	None	None	2016-07-14	 July 9, 2016
30	 The Supreme Court decision on assisted dying talks 17 times about “end-of-life”	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/jane-philpott-assisted-dying-decision/	Yes, “end-of-life” appears 17 times in the court decision that struck down the ban on physician-assisted dying. But that doesn’t support the government’s position that assisted dying be only for those near death. It appears in an array of different contexts, some relevant, some not.	None	Jane Philpott	None	None	None	2016-06-20	June 16, 2016
31	 “In this country, we have zero economic growth.”	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/kevin-oleary-zero-economic-growth/	Growth was sluggish into 2016, but only below zero in monthly data. Looking at the longer-term picture – measured quarterly and annually – Canada’s growth is above zero.	None	Kevin O’Leary	None	None	None	2016-06-13	 May 27, 2016
32	 The Liberals would be “the first government of a major democracy to change the electoral system without a direct popular mandate expressed in a referendum.”	FactsCan Score: False	http://factscan.ca/jason-kenney-electoral-reform-without-a-referendum/	Several other democratic countries have changed their electoral systems without a referendum, including Japan, Australia and France.

None	Conservative Party	None	None	None	2016-05-17	None
34	 “Canada-US relations were so bad in recent years … the old softwood lumber agreement expired.”	FactsCan Score: False	http://factscan.ca/justin-trudeau-softwood-lumber-agreement-expired/	The relationship between former Prime Minister Stephen Harper and President Barack Obama may be partly behind the expired softwood lumber deal. But according to experts, several other factors are more  likely responsible, such as complexity, lack of incentives on the US side, and the distraction of other mega free trade deals like TPP.	None	Justin Trudeau	None	None	None	2016-04-27	March 9, 2016

37	 “Our allies have … been clear that Canada should leave our CF-18s in the fight” against Islamic State	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/rona-ambrose-our-allies-have-been-clear/	The Kurdish government has been critical of Canada’s decision to withdraw its fighter jets. But other major allies in the fight have been agreeable (if vague) about the change, and at least one ally, the United States, has approved.	None	Rona Ambrose	None	None	None	2016-02-25	uary 27, 2016

Andrew Doiron that [Canadian troops] were indeed on the front line” in Iraq	FactsCan Score: False	http://factscan.ca/tom-mulcair-canadian-troops-front-line-in-iraq/	The death of a Canadian soldier in Iraq was not the first evidence of troops operating at the front lines. That information was already public. 	None	Tom Mulcair	None	None	None	2016-02-18	uary 13, 2016
39	 In Saudi Arabia, “what’s changed … is these beheadings, and particularly of a religious cleric.”	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/rona-ambrose-saudi-arabia-whats-changed/	While some facts about the January executions of 47 people are different, like the number of deaths and the profile of one person killed, experts say this is not new policy or a new trend, and not an event that came without warning.	None	Rona Ambrose	None	None	None	2016-01-28	uary 16, 2016
40	 “For the first time in our country’s history, we are making these letters public.”	FactsCan Score: True	http://factscan.ca/justin-trudeau-letters-public/	Releasing mandate letters is not unprecedented in Canadian politics. Provincial governments have done it before. But it is a first for the feds, so in that context, Trudeau’s statement is true. 	None	Justin Trudeau	None	None	None	2015-12-25	mber 13, 2015
41	 “There’s nothing in this plan about private sector employment, about job creation.”	FactsCan Score: False	http://factscan.ca/rona-ambrose-private-sector-employment/	The topic of job creation – presumably in the private sector – does make an appearance. 	None	Rona Ambrose	None	None	None	2015-12-22	ember 4, 2015
42	 “The atmosphere doesn’t care where emissions get emitted.”	FactsCan Score: True	http://factscan.ca/justin-trudeau-the-atmosphere-doesnt-care/	It’s true. The atmosphere is pretty indifferent about the location of emissions. Almost identical amounts of carbon measured in different, remote parts of the world confirm this. 	None	Justin Trudeau	None	None	None	2015-12-08	mber 30, 2015
43	 “We will have reached the number 25,000 and thereby kept our promise.”	FactsCan Score: False	http://factscan.ca/john-mccallum-kept-our-promise/	The Liberals originally promised 25,000 government-sponsored refugees by the end of 2015. The new commitment is a total of 25,000 government-sponsored refugees by the end 2016, which substantially alters the promise.	None	John McCallum	None	None	None	2015-12-03	mber 24, 2015

47	 “Everybody has some sort of ID to show who they are.”	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/pierre-poilievre-everybody-has-id/	By default of being born in Canada or immigrating, and accessing a range of basic services, it is true that we’ve all very likely been issued ID at some point, but it’s simplistic to assume everyone still has ID. And in the context of voting, Poilievre’s statement is misleading. In order to vote, people need to prove both who they are and where they live.	None	Pierre Poilievre	None	None	None	2015-10-19	July 17, 2015
48	 “This Prime Minister has the worst rate of export growth of any prime minister since World War II.”	FactsCan Score: Misleading	http://factscan.ca/justin-trudeau-worst-rate-of-export-growth/	It is true Stephen Harper’s government saw the lowest average annual growth in exports since 1946. But this is not the same thing as finding he is at fault for that record. A few experts argue he is not.	None	Justin Trudeau	None	None	None	2015-10-19	mber 28, 2015
49	 “Stephen Harper is the only prime minister in Canadian history who, when asked about the recession during his mandate, gets to say, ‘Which one?’”	FactsCan Score: False	http://factscan.ca/tom-mulcair-which-recession/	Harper is not the first prime minister to govern over a period with two recessions. Several others did too. Since 1926, there were more prime ministers who held power for over five years who saw at least two recessions than those who did not.

52	 On voting for Quebec sovereignty, Tom Mulcair carries “two different discussions at the same time.”	FactsCan Score: False	http://factscan.ca/justin-trudeau-two-different-discussions/	Mulcair did not say different things in English and French on Quebec sovereignty as Trudeau alleged. In the appearances in question, Mulcair’s position on vote count rules was consistent. 	None	Justin Trudeau	None	None	None	2015-10-08	mber 28, 2015
53	 “The past ten years … [was] a period of unprecedented economic instability.”	FactsCan Score: True	http://factscan.ca/stephen-harper-unprecedented-economic-instability/	If we ignore the major (and greater) instability of the Great Depression and look at the intervening years only, the claim is accurate. Although the 2008-2009 recession did not affect Canada as much as the recession in 1981-1982, it caused an upheaval in the global economy from which countries are still recovering at different rates, with an ongoing impact on Canada.

54	 “We have not taken away health care from immigrants and refugees. On the contrary, the only time we’ve removed it is if we had clearly bogus refugees who have been refused and turned down.”	FactsCan Score: False	http://factscan.ca/stephen-harper-health-care-from-immigrants-and-refugees/	In 2012, the Conservatives introduced health care changes that represented a cut in coverage for refugee groups beyond just rejected refugee claimants. The cuts affected ordinary claimants – people whose refugee status is, by definition, to be determined. The cuts also affected privately sponsored refugees.

55	 “The oil sands are about two per cent of GDP.”	FactsCan Score: True	http://factscan.ca/elizabeth-may-oil-sands-two-per-cent-of-gdp/	It is true the oil sands contribute a direct two per cent to Canada’s GDP, a figure that comes from Statistics Canada. This figure does not include any indirect contributions of the oil sands to related sectors, like construction and finance. By one estimate, the GDP share could rise to six or seven per cent by including indirect contributions in jobs and investment in related sectors.

56	 “Family reunification … [has] been completely shut down under Mr. Harper’s Conservatives.”	FactsCan Score: False	http://factscan.ca/tom-mulcair-family-reunification/	While changes to Canada’s family immigration stream may make it harder for certain family groups to immigrate to Canada, the stream has not completely shut down (in 2014, 66,659 people got permanent residence through the family stream). Nor have overall levels of family immigration significantly changed under the Harper government. 	None	Tom Mulcair	None	None	None	2015-09-24	mber 17, 2015
57	 Canada’s corporate tax rate is “way below that of our close trading partners.”	FactsCan Score: False	http://factscan.ca/tom-mulcair-canadas-corporate-tax-rate-trading-partners/	Canada’s combined federal and provincial corporate tax rate of 26.3 per cent is just below the middle of the pack among close trading partners. The corporate tax rate range for Canada’s top ten import and export trading partners is from a low of 16.5 per cent (Hong Kong) to a high of 39 per cent (United States).
